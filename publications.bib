   abstract = {Wearable electronic systems have garnered significant interest due to their potential in real-time health monitoring, human–machine interaction, and smart infrastructures. Most existing platforms face challenges in power sustainability, sensor bulkiness, and limited multifunctionality. Ultraflexible organic solar cells (OSCs), known for their lightweight nature and self-powered capabilities, have emerged as promising candidates for addressing these issues. Yet, current ultraflexible OSC-based devices are often limited to single functionalities with inadequate system integration and poor adaptability to complex, dynamic scenarios. Here, we present an integrated wearable solar e-skin system that combines multimodal sensing, energy harvesting, and optical wireless communication (OWC) into a single ultrathin and mechanically robust platform. Leveraging the designed ultraflexible structure and high performance of OSCs, the system enables continuous physiological monitoring, precise gesture and activity recognition, and reliable optical data transmission. By mimicking biological sensory pathways for localized signal processing and energy-efficient operation, the platform achieves enhanced functionality and reliability. Demonstrations include accurate heart rate and SpO2 monitoring, robust motion recognition with >97% accuracy, and secure OWC. This work provides a scalable and practical solution for next-generation wearable systems, offering potential in healthcare, industrial safety, and human–machine interaction.},

   abstract = {A visible light communication (VLC)-based sensing system is proposed for gait recognition and classification. Human-induced reflections are modeled using a time-varying channel representation, enabling the capture of gait dynamics without requiring wearable devices. A low-cost sensing module with embedded processing and multi-channel photodetectors is implemented. Filtered signals are transformed into spectral-spatial features and analyzed using deep learning models. Experiments involving ten participants across eight gait types demonstrate that contrastive and multi-scale models achieve over 98% accuracy, highlighting the potential of VLC-based sensing for unobtrusive, privacy-preserving, and real-time human gait recognition.},

   abstract = {Modern optical communication systems, from fiber-optic networks to optical wireless communications, are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on external power sources. This perspective highlights explores the transformative potential of self-powered optical communication (SPOTComm), a paradigm-shift technology in which optical communication is achieved without relying on external power supplies. SPOTComm opens new avenues for building sustainable and maintenance-free communication nodes for the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly in power-constrained or remote environments. In light of this, recent major breakthroughs in this interdisciplinary field and identify key challenges that impeding SPOTComm's wider adoption are reviewed. Specifically, three technical routes that establish SPOTComm link: 1) energy harvester-driven optical transmission, 2) direct mechanical-to-optical conversion, and 3) self-powered optical modulation are categorized. To enlighten future development, we offer a forward-looking vision of how materials and device innovations can overcome current limitations, ultimately enabling optical communication systems that are not only high-performance and secure, but also self-sustaining, scalable, and pervasive.},
