abstract: 'SolarSense is a self-powered sensing system for gesture recognition using
  solar cell arrays, thereby offering a sustainable approach to human-computer interaction
  (HCI) within industrial settings. The system effectively employed the sensing and
  energy harvesting capabilities of solar cells, achieving over 97.0% accuracy in
  recognizing diverse gestures. The design incorporates a low-power wireless data
  acquisition chip, a signal processing framework, and a user interface to realize
  robotic control and text input applications. SolarSense enhances HCI with its eco-friendly
  and user-centric approach, which is suitable for Internet of things (IoT) scenarios.
