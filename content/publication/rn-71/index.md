abstract: Wearable electronic systems have garnered significant interest due to their
  potential in real-time health monitoring, human–machine interaction, and smart infrastructures.
  Most existing platforms face challenges in power sustainability, sensor bulkiness,
  and limited multifunctionality. Ultraflexible organic solar cells (OSCs), known
  for their lightweight nature and self-powered capabilities, have emerged as promising
  candidates for addressing these issues. Yet, current ultraflexible OSC-based devices
  are often limited to single functionalities with inadequate system integration and
  poor adaptability to complex, dynamic scenarios. Here, we present an integrated
  wearable solar e-skin system that combines multimodal sensing, energy harvesting,
  and optical wireless communication (OWC) into a single ultrathin and mechanically
  robust platform. Leveraging the designed ultraflexible structure and high performance
  of OSCs, the system enables continuous physiological monitoring, precise gesture
  and activity recognition, and reliable optical data transmission. By mimicking biological
  sensory pathways for localized signal processing and energy-efficient operation,
  the platform achieves enhanced functionality and reliability. Demonstrations include
  accurate heart rate and SpO2 monitoring, robust motion recognition with >97% accuracy,
  and secure OWC. This work provides a scalable and practical solution for next-generation
  wearable systems, offering potential in healthcare, industrial safety, and human–machine
  interaction.
