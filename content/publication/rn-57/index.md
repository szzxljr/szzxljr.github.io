abstract: 'With the growing emphasis on maintaining wellness without disrupting daily
  routines, the demand for natural indoor health monitoring solutions has never been
  more pertinent. Traditional health monitoring methods, such as camera-based systems,
  wearable devices, millimeter-wave, and Wi-Fi technologies, face challenges like
  privacy concerns, inconvenient wearability, and susceptibility to interference due
  to crowded frequency bands. Addressing these issues, we designed an integrated system
  that combines communication, sensing, lighting, and health applications using visible
  light communication (VLC) technology, achieving non-intrusive and passive human
  indoor posture and activity monitoring. Firstly, a low-cost VLC device is deployed
  for systematic basic functionality. A low-powered chip for data acquisition and
  processing is also designed to analyze modulated light signals reflected off or
  obstructed by individuals. Furthermore, an optical human posture and activity recognition
  model is developed to analyze VLC signals captured by receivers. The system employs
  a streamlined algorithm for signal analysis, incorporating preprocessing steps like
  filtering, normalization, and downsampling to enhance data quality. Three machine
  learning models are used for classification: Random forest, decision tree, and support
  vector machines (SVM), emphasizing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency
  in real-time monitoring. The monitoring signals and analyzing results are transmitted
  wirelessly to a user-friendly app on a smartphone. The experimental results demonstrate
  that our system achieves an accuracy rate exceeding 90% in the detection and monitoring
  of human postures and activities. The results suggest that our VLC-based system
  can achieve real-time, affordable, non-intrusive, scalable, and effective indoor
  posture and activity monitoring. This system has diverse applications for health
  monitoring in smart homes and healthcare facilities.'
