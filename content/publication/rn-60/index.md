abstract: As wireless communication rapidly evolves and the demand for intelligent
  connectivity grows, the need for precise sensing integrated with efficient communication
  becomes paramount. While traditional Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)
  methods have laid foundational groundwork, they grapple with environmental limitations
  and significant propagation losses. Visible Light Communication (VLC) emerges as
  a transformative solution characterized by its high-speed transmission, minimal
  latency, cost-efficiency, and seamless installation. This paper introduces the Lighting,
  Sensing, and Communication (LiSAC) concept for VLC and systematically reviews the
  technical aspects, such as channel characteristics, modulation techniques, and system
  design. Specifically, this paper presents the evolution of the LiSAC system, its
  integration with other communication technologies, its applications in various fields,
  and its challenges. At the end of this paper, we outlooked LiSAC in the future,
  in which high-quality communication will integrate pinpoint sensing accuracy.
