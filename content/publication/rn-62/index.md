abstract: Wearable technologies provide a non-invasive way to monitor user's activity,
  identity, and health in real-time, which have attracted tremendous interests from
  both academia and industry. Due to constraints in form factor and power consumption,
  the sensing capabilities and functionalities of the wearables are usually limited
  by the available sensors. In the past decade, researchers have committed to realizing
  the sensing capability of multiple sensors via the signal from one sensor, which
  expanded the functionalities and sensing domains of traditional sensors. For the
  first time, we defined such sensing approach as “cross-sensing” and provided a comprehensive
  review on the cross-sensing towards wearable applications (i.e., human-machine interface,
  health services, and security). Specifically, this paper summarized the applied
  signal processing and machine learning algorithms, and discussed how cross-sensing
  would affect the development and innovation trends of wearable electronics.
