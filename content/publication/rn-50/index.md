abstract: 'As human-computer interaction (HCI) advances, gesture recognition has emerged
  as a transformative technology for human-computer interaction. Traditional methods,
  often camera or glove-based, are restricted by various environmental conditions
  and user-specific demands, highlighting the need for more universal, non-intrusive,
  and sustainable solutions. Addressing this, we present PowerGest, a self-powered
  gesture recognition system based on a solar cell array. This innovative system leverages
  the dual functionalities of solar cells: energy harvesting and gesture sensing,
  providing an alternative to conventional methods. It integrates a designed low-powered
  data acquisition chip with a wireless transmission module and a user-friendly interface.
  PowerGest employs a series of signal processing methods and utilizes several machine
  learning algorithms, achieving over 97% accuracy for both numeric input and activity
  control gesture recognition tasks. With its broad applications in robotic control,
  text input, and more, PowerGest contributes to a more sustainable and intuitive
  HCI experience. Project demo: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10KEul8PAfvTUomi0JvZ8u411JyScCXQI?usp=sharing.'
