abstract: Effective fall detection is a critical component of indoor health monitoring
  for individuals. The most widely used wearable devices are not convenient, especially
  for the elderly. Another approach of passive solutions usually use RGB camera, millimeter-wave
  radar, or WiFi. However, they bring about issues of privacy infringement and/or
  electromagnetic interference. Among them, visible light-based systems can avoid
  these issues, however, they require customized light sources and highly sensitive
  receivers, making it expensive for deployment. Motivated by these previous works,
  we aim to design a passive, low-invasiveness, and low-cost fall detection system.
  In this work, we propose LiFall, a passive fall detection system based on illumination
  and visible light communication (VLC) networks, which eliminates the need for hardware
  modifications to current devices. LiFall detects human falls by analyzing the intensity
  variation of the received optical signals captured by the low-cost photodetectors.
  Subsequently, we propose an innovative signal segmentation algorithm tailored for
  accurately segmenting human activities in the time series. Compared to existing
  double-window segmentation schemes, our method enhances the signal integrity by
  20%. In order to identify falls, we analyze the temporal statistical features and
  waveform characteristics derived from human activity signals and adopt the lightweight
  classifiers of support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF) for fall detection.
  We deploy LiFall system in various typical indoor scenarios and collect human fall
  and other daily activity data for system performance evaluation. Experimental results
  demonstrate that LiFall is able to achieve a fall detection accuracy exceeding 90%
  in different typical indoor settings without compromising illumination and communication.
