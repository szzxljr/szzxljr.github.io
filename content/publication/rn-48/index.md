abstract: The rapid evolution of machine learning and computer vision has given rise
  to numerous new tasks, primarily driven by deep convolutional neural networks’ ability
  to create complex mappings between feature space X and label space Y. These tasks
  often necessitate large-scale, human-labeled datasets for supervised training of
  the network. However, manual labeling is both costly and time-consuming. To overcome
  this hurdle, it is imperative to develop algorithms that can leverage existing labeled
  datasets to extract knowledge about the target domain. While most prior research
  has focused on single-source transfer learning, our study delves into multi-source
  transfer across various domains and tasks. The paper presents an improved cross-domain
  data analytics model that supports multi-source transfer learning by training a
  classifier to re-weight different sources and adjusting the rich and intricate information
  among sources to boost target learning. Experiments involving two source domains
  transferring to a single target domain showcase the effectiveness of our methodology.
  The model’s potential applications in image recognition include object recognition,
  medical imaging diagnosis, and so on. Future research could explore the scalability
  of the model to accommodate larger datasets and further refine the transfer learning
  process for more efficient knowledge extraction.
