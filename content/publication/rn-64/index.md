abstract: This paper studies the consensus problem for gen-erallinear MASs under directed
  graphs that full-state measurements are not available. Based on output feedback,
  we propose an observer-based event-triggered controller to achieve consensus. Each
  agent only needs to monitor its own output feedback by its observer continuously
  and updates its controllers and broadcast it to its out-neighbors when it triggers
  an event or receives new information from its in-neighbors. It is proved that the
  MAS reaches consensus for all initial conditions and no Zeno behavior exhibits.
  Furthermore, when there exists a leader, the proposed control protocol can also
  lead all the followers to track the leader's state. At last, simulation is given
  to show the theoretical analysis and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
  controll methods.
