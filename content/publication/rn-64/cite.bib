 abstract = {This paper studies the consensus problem for gen-erallinear MASs under directed graphs that full-state measurements are not available. Based on output feedback, we propose an observer-based event-triggered controller to achieve consensus. Each agent only needs to monitor its own output feedback by its observer continuously and updates its controllers and broadcast it to its out-neighbors when it triggers an event or receives new information from its in-neighbors. It is proved that the MAS reaches consensus for all initial conditions and no Zeno behavior exhibits. Furthermore, when there exists a leader, the proposed control protocol can also lead all the followers to track the leader's state. At last, simulation is given to show the theoretical analysis and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controll methods.},
