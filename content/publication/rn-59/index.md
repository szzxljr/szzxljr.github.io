abstract: Floor-based sensing systems to monitor human activities and identify users
  are essential for smart homes and intelligent buildings. A low-cost, easy-to-fabricate,
  and flexible gait sensor system based on triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is presented
  in this paper, which can transform gait movements, even in the low-frequency form,
  into electrical impulses without an external power source. To realize this, a TENG-based
  gait sensor unit with an optimized structure design is proposed to enhance the sensing
  sensitivity. A sensing insole module is formed by arranging the sensor units according
  to the foot pressure distribution. The sensor distribution is then explored and
  improved by comparative studies of gait recognition performance, which increases
  the recognition efficiency and the possible application in edge computing scenarios.
  Furthermore, a deep learning network is developed based on long short-term memory
  (LSTM) and residual units to extract deep features from multichannel time-series
  gait data to boost recognition performance. Experimental results demonstrate that
  the proposed gait sensor system can be utilized for human activity recognition and
  user identification with accuracies of 97.9 % and 99.4 %, respectively. Finally,
  a gait-sensing-based fitness exercise monitoring system is constructed that can
  estimate calorie expenditure and distinguish between standard and non-standard fitness
  activities with an accuracy of 97.2 %. This work can be extended to various application
  scenarios such as security surveillance, health monitoring, and intelligent control,
  which provides a new ubiquitous self-powered sensing solution for the Internet of
  Things (IoT).
