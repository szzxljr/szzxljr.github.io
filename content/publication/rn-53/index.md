abstract: In response to the challenges presented by conventional material and texture
  recognition methods, our research introduces a system using visible light communication
  (VLC) technology. This approach provides a non-contact, non-destructive, dual-functional
  solution, overcoming the limitations of cost, safety, and environmental adaptability
  associated with traditional methods. Through a comprehensive design integrating
  hardware and software, our system utilizes VLC for precise and efficient recognition.
  Extensive testing confirms its effectiveness, achieving 97.7% accuracy in material
  identification and 93.8% in texture detection. This study highlights VLC's potential
  in enhancing automated recognition systems across various applications.
