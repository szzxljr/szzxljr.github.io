abstract: "Modern optical communication systems, from fiber-optic networks to optical
  wireless communications, are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on external
  power sources. This perspective highlights explores the transformative potential
  of self-powered optical communication (SPOTComm), a paradigm-shift technology in
  which optical communication is achieved without relying on external power supplies.
  SPOTComm opens new avenues for building sustainable and maintenance-free communication
  nodes for the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly in power-constrained or remote
  environments. In light of this, recent major breakthroughs in this interdisciplinary
  field and identify key challenges that impeding SPOTComm's wider adoption are reviewed.
  Specifically, three technical routes that establish SPOTComm link: 1) energy harvester-driven
  optical transmission, 2) direct mechanical-to-optical conversion, and 3) self-powered
  optical modulation are categorized. To enlighten future development, we offer a
  forward-looking vision of how materials and device innovations can overcome current
  limitations, ultimately enabling optical communication systems that are not only
  high-performance and secure, but also self-sustaining, scalable, and pervasive."
