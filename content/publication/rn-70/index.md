abstract: A visible light communication (VLC)-based sensing system is proposed for
  gait recognition and classification. Human-induced reflections are modeled using
  a time-varying channel representation, enabling the capture of gait dynamics without
  requiring wearable devices. A low-cost sensing module with embedded processing and
  multi-channel photodetectors is implemented. Filtered signals are transformed into
  spectral-spatial features and analyzed using deep learning models. Experiments involving
  ten participants across eight gait types demonstrate that contrastive and multi-scale
  models achieve over 98% accuracy, highlighting the potential of VLC-based sensing
  for unobtrusive, privacy-preserving, and real-time human gait recognition.
