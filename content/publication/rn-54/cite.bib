 abstract = {This research focuses on ubiquitous sensing systems for activity and gesture recognition through novel optical sensing and energy harvesting technologies such as triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG), solar cells, and visible light communication (VLC). The primary goal is to address the limitations of existing sensing systems by creating a low-cost, energy-efficient, comprehensive solution that enhances sensor integration and communication. Thus, this study utilizes TENG for contact sensing, solar cells for non-contact sensing, and VLC for spatial sensing. The applied methodologies achieve activity and gesture recognition, with accuracies up to 99.4% and 97.3%, respectively. This work has potential applications in smart home automation, health monitoring, and intelligent control by providing a more sustainable and user-friendly approach to ubiquitous sensing.},
