abstract: Accurately and continuously measuring and collecting data on human gait
  is critical for human activity recognition and individual identification, enabling
  various applications in smart homes/buildings, including security authentication,
  personal healthcare, and intelligent automation. Many sensing technologies have
  been investigated by researchers recently, such as camera-based, laser-based, and
  mobile approaches, which have limitations in particular sensing situations, such
  as environments with fewer privacy concerns, line-of-sight, and the use of wearables,
  etc. On the other hand, the floor with the embedded sensor is stable and robust
  to different circumstances, enabling non-intrusive gait recognition and human identification.
  Therefore, a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)-based gait sensor system installed
  on the floor is proposed in this paper. Our approach has many advantages in comparison
  to the existing gait recognition systems, including low cost, simple fabrication,
  lightweight, and high durability. The TENG-based sensors can be simply embedded
  into a smart carpet to discern mechanical motions through electrical signals. Furthermore,
  a deep learning model, deep residual bidirectional long short-term memory network
  with dense layers (Residual Dense-BiLSTM), is proposed for multichannel floor-based
  gait recognition. By utilizing this model to analyze the electrical outputs, our
  system can accurately detect various human activities and distinguish different
  individuals’ walking patterns, with a recognition rate over 98% and 97%, respectively.
  We conclude that the proposed deep learning enabled triboelectric gait sensor system
  has broad applications in security and healthcare.
