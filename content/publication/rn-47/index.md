abstract: The demand for accurate and real-time indoor localization and human sensing
  is rising with the development of smart environments, with applications in security
  and smart homes. Effective systems enhance safety, energy efficiency, and user experience
  by leveraging existing infrastructure, reducing deployment costs, and integrating
  seamlessly. Traditional methods rely on dedicated hardware, while communication
  or lighting infrastructure can provide dual-purpose solutions. This research focuses
  on Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology, which uses visible light for data
  transmission. Our VLC system utilizes existing lighting infrastructure to transmit
  data, providing localization and human sensing functionalities. The system design
  strategically incorporates specific VLC transmitters and receivers to enhance sensing
  performance. The collected data is processed using advanced algorithms and machine
  learning models, ensuring robust, real-time, and cost-effective localization with
  an accuracy of 96.6% and human activity recognition with an accuracy of 98.3%. This
  multi-functionality system demonstrates the potential for VLC in healthcare monitoring
  and home automation applications.
