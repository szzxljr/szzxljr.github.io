abstract: In this paper, we study the finite-time containment consensus problem for
  multi-agent systems with general linear dynamics. Finite time consensus can reach
  consensus faster and have better disturbance rejection properties compared with
  conventional asymptotic consensus. Hence, we propose a distributed, independent
  and asynchronous event-triggered control protocol with leaders. We demonstrate that
  each follower agent can achieve consensus to the convex hull spanned by the leaders'
  agents in a certain time regardless of the initial condition under this event-triggered
  control strategy.
