 abstract = {In this paper, we study the finite-time containment consensus problem for multi-agent systems with general linear dynamics. Finite time consensus can reach consensus faster and have better disturbance rejection properties compared with conventional asymptotic consensus. Hence, we propose a distributed, independent and asynchronous event-triggered control protocol with leaders. We demonstrate that each follower agent can achieve consensus to the convex hull spanned by the leaders' agents in a certain time regardless of the initial condition under this event-triggered control strategy.},
