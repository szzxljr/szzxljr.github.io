abstract: The evolution of human-computer interaction (HCI), particularly in the era
  of the Internet of Things (IoT), demands innovative solutions that transcend traditional
  interfaces like keyboards and touchscreens. This study introduces a visible light
  communication (VLC) based sensing system for non-contact gesture recognition in
  HCI. The system utilizes a cost-effective VLC setup optimized for indoor environments,
  ensuring precise signal transmission and reception. The data acquisition and processing
  board can accurately capture and analyze light-based hand gesture signals. This
  process is supported by a comprehensive signal processing framework that includes
  data preprocessing steps and robust machine learning algorithms. These algorithms
  are designed to detect subtle light pattern variations due to gestures, ensuring
  an accurate and responsive recognition process. The system’s effectiveness is confirmed
  by its high gesture recognition accuracy of 95.7%. The study’s key contributions
  include the development of a VLC-based system for gesture recognition and control,
  the integration of diverse signal processing techniques suitable for VLC-based data,
  and the successful demonstration of the system’s practical application through extensive
  experimental evaluations. These evaluations have validated the system’s efficacy
  in real-world scenarios, marking an advancement in VLC-enabled HCI. The research
  highlights VLC’s potential as a user-friendly and efficient interface in HCI, offering
  more intuitive and responsive interactions in smart environments.
